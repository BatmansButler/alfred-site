                Our goal at Endowl is to transform estate planning from an opaque and hard to understand process into
                something simple and empowering. </p>
            <p>
                We are interviewing users like you to make sure we create the friendliest estate planning tool ever.
            </p>
            <p>
                We would love to hear your feedback and get your thoughts on our demo application. It doesn't matter
                whether
            <ul>
                <li>You currently have an estate plan</li>
                <li>Aren't sure whether you need one</li>
                <li>Know you need one, but haven't gotten around doing it</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We aren't trying to sell you anything, we just need your feedback. We want to build an application that
                helps you identify the things and people that are most important to you and use that as a foundation for
                an estate plan.
            </p>
            <p>
