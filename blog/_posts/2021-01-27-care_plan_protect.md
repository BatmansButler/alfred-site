68% of Americans don’t have a will. And yet, 60% of those same people say they need one. Without putting too much thought into it, it’s easy to write off estate planning as something you don’t consider a priority at this point in your life, or that you don’t quite own enough to get started. But when you spend a little more time with the idea, do you think about your family photos? Your digital assets? Everyone cares about something worth protecting. 

So, what do you care about?

## Are you a collector? 
If you have a collection, whether you know its value or not, might be high on the list of things to include in your estate plan. No matter how big or small, do you know where it’s going to end up upon your passing? Is there someone special in your life that you’d like to inherit your collection?

Many people collect things that have significantly appreciated in value over time: if you have some old Star Wars figurines in mint condition, those might be worth a lot of money now. Do you want a family member in need to keep them safe, or sell them to aid with financial stress? The same goes for things like coins, stamps, watches, etc. Millions of people in the US alone have vintage collections that should have a proper home to go to once you die. With 140 million coin collectors and 5 million stamp collectors, one of those could be you; or maybe, an older relative. 

If you were left something similar in someone else’s will, it’s necessary to include that in yours as well. If you don’t, you could miss out on passing on a family heirloom that’s been passed down for generations, or lose a box of vintage comic books that are worth tens of thousands of dollars. 

## Passionate about any causes?
If charitable giving is something you regularly participate in, you may care to continue doing so upon your passing. You may donate monthly to St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital, or perhaps you’re a long time volunteer with Habitat for Humanity. If that sounds like you, don’t you want to continue giving back with the some of the funds you saved during your lifetime? 

There is a lot to consider when it comes to charitable donations, and there’s a good chance you haven’t thought about it too much, or even know how to start. But don’t worry, it’s not as difficult as you may think.
