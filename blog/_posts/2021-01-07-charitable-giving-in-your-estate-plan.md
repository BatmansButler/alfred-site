Making donations to worthy causes is a noble deed. Maybe this is something you already do, or just something you’re trying to start doing. No matter your current relationship with donating to charity, if you have the means, it’s a smart idea to include charitable giving in your estate plan. Not only are you providing funds for organizations that are important to you, but you can also benefit your heirs as well. What are a few ways to do this, you might ask? Well, there are many ways you can leave money to charity upon the execution of your estate plan, and choosing the right one will maximize your donation to the organization of your choosing, and minimize the cost for your family.

You don’t have to give a large amount for your gift to be meaningful. Even modest amounts can help a charity in its mission. Even if your estate includes a few hundred dollars for your favorite charity, it is a reminder to those who survive you of the causes that were important to you. It becomes part of the legacy that you leave behind.

## Donating to an important cause
If you aren’t yet well acquainted with a charity that holds a special place in your heart, but you’d like to add a charitable donation to your will, there are many to choose from that support a wide range of causes. There are dozens upon dozens of charities that would be wonderful places to leave a donation. Do some research, or even ask some of your loved ones if there are any particular organizations they are passionate about. The charity you choose should be special to you, as you are putting it in your legacy, after all. While there are several personal benefits to donating, the real reward is knowing that you will be giving back to those in need.

## Methods of Donation
Once you know exactly what organization you’d like to include in your estate plan, it’s time to figure out what and how you will give. Of course, this will depend on your own preferences and needs.

### Appreciated Stock
A great way to donate is with appreciated stock. If you’ve traded stock publicly and it’s value has appreciated, giving these funds to charity will allow you to avoid paying any capital gains taxes on your assets. The less taxes that need to be paid, the better!

### Bequest
Simply leaving a statement in your will or trust indicating the amount you’d like to donate and the charity for which it will be received is an easy way to give funds to a charitable purpose. You can even specify how you would like for the charity to utilize your donation.

When you put a bequest in your retirement account, you will eliminate the need for the charity to pay income taxes on the donation, allowing the funds to go further. It will also help lessen the burden of estate taxes on your family. This method is easy to both manage and execute, making the process less stressful on you now, and less stressful on your family later. 

## Getting the Most Out of Your Plan
As you can see, there’s a lot you can do to optimize the advantages you create for yourself when you make an estate plan, and charitable giving is just one of them. When you choose to donate to a charity organization, you’re helping out others in the best way possible, and lessing the financial burden for your family all at the same time.

As you continue on your legacy planning journey, you’ll only continue to discover more and more  ways to protect yourself and your loved ones in the future.
