Recently, we talked about [including charitable giving in your estate plan](https://endowl.com/blog/2021/01/07/charitable-giving-in-your-estate-plan.html), and went over a few ways that leaving charity donations in your will can optimize your savings. But wait, there’s more! In addition to what we already discussed, there’s another tax-exempt donation method that does more than just save your family money—it provides it, as well.

# What is it?
A Charitable Remainder Trust allows you to leave money for a loved one and a charity at the same time. When this trust is named as the beneficiary of your Individual Retirement Account, your family member will be able to acquire funds prior to the charity donation. There are regulations on how long and how much money can be received, and the charity itself is to get a certain percentage upon the funding of the trust.

# How you can benefit
The benefits are clear: engage in philanthropy, but continue to generate an income for a family member. By donating to a charity, you’re allowing yourself to save money that can otherwise be used to help out those who will be taking care of your estate upon your passing. With a CRT, the person of your choosing will receive payments from your IRA for a certain amount of time, and afterward, the remaining assets are donated to the charity you chose: everybody wins.

With the income tax deductions, you’re able to better preserve any assets you own that have appreciated in value. These same assets might be subject to capital gains taxes without a CRT in place, which would leave you with a lot less than you’d like.

# Why choose a CRT?
This option might work well for you if you’re dedicated to a particular cause and have assets you’d like them to have, but would like to provide for a family member in need at the same time. With the means to do so, you could do a lot for your loved ones and a foundation with a meaningful cause.

Like a charity, a CRT is tax exempt while it’s operable. After your death, your loved ones will have a lot to deal with. If they might be unable to work for any reason, a CRT will allow them to have a steady income for a particular period of time, which can alleviate many of the stressors that can come with working full time and budgeting. It’s always nice to provide for others in need, but it’s important to be sure your family’s needs are being addressed as well. This way, it’s a two birds with one stone type of thing.

When you plan your estate with Endowl, all the boring, stressful aspects of creating your will are eliminated. If you’re interested in a Charitable Remainder Trust, Endowl can simplify that for you, too.
