Everyone has different areas of expertise. When you have a need, you typically want an expert or professional to help you out. It’s why people hire accountants to do their taxes for them, plumbers to fix leaking pipes, and wedding planners to organize their big day. It’s also why many flock to attorneys for estate planning needs; this isn’t an obtainable option for everyone, though. 

There’s always the Do-It-Yourself alternative, which can be cost efficient when you’re working with a budget. No matter what it is, DIY doesn’t always go well, even with the best of intentions. We’ve all tried to put IKEA furniture together, haven’t we? This can be just as true with DIY estate planning as with any other project you take on yourself. But, when you choose Endowl, DIY becomes easier than ever. 

## What is DIY Estate Planning?
Do-It-Yourself has become an increasingly popular option when it comes to estate planning. This is due to the fact that it can be easier, and is typically a lot cheaper. Doing your own estate plan may feel like extra work, and there’s always the fear of doing something wrong. Obviously, you don’t want to mess up something as important as your will.

DIY estate planning is usually assisted by a site or software that will generate your will for you, and all you have to do is fill in the blanks. Sounds easy! Of course, this can leave room for error, as you probably aren’t an estate planning expert by default. You might skip over important details, accidentally create something that isn’t legally binding, or forget to include necessary information. While there are many tools out there that can be useful, it’s always good to be certain that everything is done correctly and securely. Unfortunately, this isn’t always possible with some of the readily available DIY programs for estate planning. That’s where Endowl comes in.
