If you own any sort of cryptocurrency and don’t leave behind a way for a trusted family member to access it when you die, all of those assets will be impossible to retrieve and wind up abandoned. So unless you want your cryptocurrency to be forfeited to the state or permanently lost, it’s crucial that you manage and protect your digital assets properly long before it would ever become a problem. 

## Protecting Your Crypto 
The best way to prevent your cryptocurrency from dying with you is to securely add it to your will. But how do you do that? I’m so glad you asked. Your heirs can inherit the crypto assets you own when your will contains very specific information about it. Since crypto wallets are extremely secure for your protection, someone you love and trust should be named the beneficiary of your cryptocurrencies, along with instructions on how to access your accounts and information, as well as directions on what it should be used for and how it should be managed, if that’s also necessary. 

Not only will you have to lock this future inheritance into your will, you need to make sure that whoever is going to end up with your assets knows how to handle them. If, say, you’d like your nephew to inherit all of your Bitcoin, things will become a bit tricky for him if this becomes a surprise, especially if the instructions are unclear in any way. 

Luckily, the Endowl app makes all of this simple. When you create an estate plan with Endowl, you are walked through each step to ensure that everything is managed correctly and safely. You can store your account info, list beneficiaries, and detail instructions for the use of your cryptocurrencies once you’re gone; we will even let your heirs know they are included in your plan! With the help of third-party plugins, this can happen all in one place, quickly and efficiently. 

## Giving Crypto to a Charity
If you’d like to leave funds to a charity in your will, you can use your cryptocurrencies to do this in lieu of a regular monetary donation. As our world becomes more digital each day, it’s necessary to adjust and become more digital ourselves. Many nonprofits and charitable organizations are doing just that by accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency donations. If you want to leave your crypto to a charity, your estate plan should include instructions on how to send it to the charity. Most charities aren’t set up to accept cryptocurrency directly. Fortunately, companies like the Giving Block can help. The Giving Block has helped raise millions of dollars by connecting donors to charities, while fundraising crypto and saving donors money on taxes at the same time. Mentioning the Giving Block in your will can help insure that your gift gets to the charity when your estate is being settled.

## The Time to Act is Now
Don’t let your Bitcoin fall in with the several million that have already been lost. Start protecting your assets and your loved ones by planning your estate with Endowl. Keep your cryptocurrency in your family and pass it down to your heirs, or leave some behind for a cause you care about. Of course, there’s no one stopping you from doing both! Endowl can help you protect your assets and your family, saving you time, worry, and money, no matter how you decide to do it. 


Endowl was born from a very basic crypto asset inheritance system that was built as a Hackathon project at EthDenver 2020. We are hacking at EthDenver 2021 again this year. If you are attending, be sure to watch for us in the hackathon presentations on Friday, February 12. To find out more about EthDenver, go to https://ethdenver.com.
