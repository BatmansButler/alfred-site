The current system of storing and protecting information isn’t as efficient as it needs to be for a multitude of reasons. Because of this, it's imperative to move forward with better, more innovative methods of recordkeeping. The new technology that is blockchain doesn’t rely on external validation the way mainstream processes do. Instead of placing trust in any individual authority figure, the trust is placed in the hands of the entire system as a whole. 

## Defining Trustless
To get onboard with trustless trust, it’s important to become familiar with what trustless really means for technology. 

Stepping away from one central figure of authority when it comes to records and transactions opens doors to new opportunities. With these new opportunities, better security and structure present themselves in the form of trustless trust. The idea of trustless trust takes away the need to have concern over the individual actors at play, as the system itself holds the trust instead. So, the product of the system is trustworthy by default. 

In this sense, trustless doesn’t necessarily mean without trust, it just provides the term with a new meaning. 

## Blockchain to the Rescue
This new technology eliminates the risks associated with other more traditional methods of recording and managing stored information, while reducing the costs and improving the effectiveness of the process. While other processes and business models require transactional fees, blockchain differentiates itself by making this unnecessary.

With blockchain, everything is automated, has no hidden fees, and its architecture makes capital flows in your estate transparent. How could you say no to that? When blockchain technology is implemented throughout the different aspects of our lives, trust becomes unnecessary.
