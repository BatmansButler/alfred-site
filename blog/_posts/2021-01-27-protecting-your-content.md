Your content is important, no matter what it is. And you like to protect what’s important to you, right? Of course you do! This is why you might have a social token, or why you might be interested in one. This allows you to curate your content and interact with your community the way you think is best, in the safest way possible.

When you have a token and a community you care about, it’s important to consider how these things will be handled if anything were to ever happen to you. Just as Facebook allows you to appoint someone as a legacy contact to manage your profile if you were to pass away, you can have a beneficiary for your token, as well.

Wait, what? Let’s unpack all of that.

## What are social tokens?
Your digital content is unique and valuable. But, it’s hard to see that value in its best form when social platforms are diluted with everything under the sea, to the point where it can be difficult to discover new creators and even be discovered yourself by potential fans of your work. And, with so much out there, it’s not easy for smaller creators to monetize their content, and those potential funds would give them the opportunity to do more with their platform, and grow their follower base.

This is where social tokens come in. MintGate allows you to create a token to protect your digital media, allowing supporters to use their own tokens to be granted access to specialized content you hand selected. Doing this also gives you a chance to collaborate with your community as a creator, as well as form closer bonds with those who find what you do enjoyable. To put it simply, tokens place value in your community and provide opportunities for growing your social platform.

## The need for a beneficiary
Now to the big question: what happens to your token and the tokens within your community if you were to experience an unexpected death? Considering your own mortality is no one’s cup of tea, but it’s something you need to do as a precaution in order to protect yourself, your content, and those you care the most about, including your community and loved ones.

Adding a beneficiary will give someone of your choosing the ability to oversee your token and content upon your passing. Even when you’re gone, your digital assets are left behind. If you don’t provide your family with the ability to access your information, it will be an added stress for them to figure out, and you probably won’t have everything handled the way you would have wanted.

You may have a business that you are perfectly capable of running, but if everything you spent so much time and hard work on is suddenly there without you, it would be nice for a loved one to be left with the means to manage those things. By taking care of these housekeeping tasks now, your content and loved ones will be in much better shape if anything unexpected were to happen.

## MintGate and Endowl
MintGate and Endowl will be working together over the coming months to protect your content with content tokens AND have your beneficiary information secure in your Endowl estate plan. This frictionless process will eliminate any need to bounce between your tokens and your estate plan; your assets can be managed with ease, and you’ll have a safety net prepared just in case you need to use it.
