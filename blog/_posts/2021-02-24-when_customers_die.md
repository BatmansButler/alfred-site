When you have a client or customer you’ve frequently worked with, it’s important to be aware of their passing to properly manage the end of your professional relationship. It can be difficult to process, especially when dealing with communicating with their grieving loved ones. If approached correctly, you can successfully resolve your business together while honoring the value they brought to you during their life. With Endowl, connecting with the family of deceased clients is easier than ever. 

## Finding Out a Customer has Passed
It can be awkward to try to reach out to a client just to discover they have passed away. It can also be unsettling for the loved ones of the deceased to get bills or notifications in the mail and not know how to deal with them. You might discover of the death through the family directly, or maybe you saw their obituary or were concerned when communication or payments suddenly ceased. 

No matter how you find out, it can be complicated and hard to manage. As a plugin partner of Endowl, however, this can change. Imagine how much simpler it would be not only for you, but for the loved ones of your customer if you were notified as soon as the death is confirmed and able to deal with their accounts easily? Death is a difficult thing to deal with. The most sensical thing to do is make that difficult thing a little less stressful. 

## Expressing Condolences 
Before doing anything else, it’s important to let your client’s loved ones know that you are sorry for their loss and thinking about them during this tough time. If your client passes away, the family of the deceased would be nothing but appreciative if you reached out to offer your condolences. Depending on your relationship, you might want to do so in a more personal or more professional manner. If you had a long standing, close relationship with this person, you may even be a family friend or have some other connection with one or more of their relatives. In this case, you may not need much guidance when it comes to communicating with the loved ones of the deceased. You may even want to send a gift, card, or attend the funeral service. 

Although, this isn’t always the case; especially if you work for a larger company and don’t necessarily know the client personally. If you’re not that close with the client or their family, it’s still important to reach out and let them know you’re sorry for their loss. Inevitably, they are grieving and in need of comfort, as well as space to get everything sorted out. The most important thing, no matter the relationship had with the client, is to be kind and understanding. 

By showing indifference or only expressing interest in collecting payments or closing the account, you don’t give off the impression that your company cares that much about the people who bring you their business, and it can be extremely hurtful to the family. Not only does this look bad for your company, but it’s unkind and not the way you’d want to be treated if the roles were reversed. You want to be seen as a business full of caring, kind people—it’s good to genuinely care about others, especially those you have a history of working with. 

Of course, as the loved ones may not be a client of yours as well, it might not be the easiest thing to do to get in contact with them. If you’re connected through Endowl, you will know exactly who to call and what next steps to take once that disheartening notification is received. Contact the family with ease, and be there for them as soon as you find out. 

## Ending Business
Unfortunately, you most likely will still need to process their death from a business standpoint, as well. This might mean closing or freezing any accounts they may have owned, notifying other companies you’re involved with that they will no longer be a customer, or distribution of assets held by you on behalf of the customer. If you had a relationship with their spouse, parent, or child as well, they may even inherit the account and need for it to be transferred into their name. 

You’ll need to make sure that any payments needed from them get redirected, and payments to them are changed to be received by their spouse or the beneficiary in their will. It’s even possible that you and your business were noted in the will itself, that way you are already provided with instructions and had been notified of the death early on. It can be helpful to list people or companies you have a solid professional relationship with in your will, not only to make it easier for your loved ones to organize your assets and accounts, but to simplify the process for them, as well. 

While there’s much to deal with when a client passes away, the thing that matters most is being there for the family and displaying sincerity in your condolences. When someone passes away, the focus should be on the comfort of the family before tying up any loose ends. But, when the time does come, your connection to them through Endowl will be a huge help.
