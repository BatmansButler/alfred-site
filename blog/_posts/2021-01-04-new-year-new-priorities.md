It’s easy to have high hopes for your New Year’s resolution and then watch them fade pretty quickly — it happens to the best of us. Early in the year, you start to get caught up with a slew of different things, and that promise you made gets pushed to the back of your mind along with the laundry that needs to get done or the filing cabinets you keep telling yourself you’ll organize next weekend. 

This time, keep your resolution a promise, and not an empty one. When you decide to start considering your estate plan, you should feel proud of that decision. While following through on your resolution can be tough, it’s useful to have a little help remembering why you made it in the first place.

## Looking Forward to a Better Year
If you made a New Year’s resolution to start considering your estate plan, what was your reason? Was it to preserve your legacy? Or maybe to protect your family’s financial health? Last year was a heavy weight to carry, and it brought up a question of mortality that no one likes to think about.

But, when it comes to your family, considering those hard questions becomes crucial. So, what will happen to them when you pass on, especially if that day comes unexpectedly? In the best case scenario, you have full control over your personal belongings and assets, as well as the hands in which they end up.

Your estate plan ensures that your family will have easy access to your secured accounts, and that your children, significant other, and even parents will be taken care of exactly how you wanted. When life seems to be full of chaos, it’s nice to know that you and your family’s future doesn’t have to be quite so crazy.

While last year wasn’t the year anyone had hoped for, that doesn’t mean this year has to take on a similar trajectory. No matter what the coming months have in store, the best thing to do is charge forward and make the most out of any situation you find yourself in. A better year means better planning; better planning leads to a better future.

## The Important Things in Life
When you think of a better future, what comes to mind? You probably think about having more money, maintaining personal happiness, avoiding any sort of stress that might be hiding around the corner. You most likely think about your family and friends, and how you want the same things for them. It’s natural to be concerned about the people most valuable to you. At the end of the day, they are what’s important, what’s worth your worry.

Placing this worry into your estate plan puts that apprehension somewhere safe, where all of those what if fears you have about your family can be addressed. Who will take care of your dog when you’re not around anymore? Will your children still have a roof over their head and food on the table? How will your significant other deal with everything?

You want your loved ones to have a wonderful life, whether you are there or not. If 2020 taught us anything, it’s that you should be prepared for the unexpected. If the day comes where you are unexpectedly no longer around, your estate plan will be there for your family. They will be taken care of, your questions will have been answered, and with you forever in their hearts, they can move forward.
