In a domestic partnership, you aren’t granted the automatic legal benefits that come with marriage. So, any protections you have within this partnership need to be arranged separately. Without an estate plan, your benefits and protections are extremely limited. 

## What is a Domestic Partnership?
Domestic partnership is a relationship between two people who live together and share a life, but are not married to one another, or anyone else. 

There are many reasons two people might decide to form a domestic partnership instead of opting for marriage. For any number of personal reasons, you and your partner might not want to be married. In certain states, you can register for a certificate of domestic partnership that will grant you certain legal rights. This option is available to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. 

In states where domestic partnership is legally recognized, you are granted a limited amount of benefits, including hospital visitation rights, the ability to be covered under the other’s insurance, the opportunity to transfer property ownership, among others. This can be a great option for those who simply are not interested in marriage, or are in a long term nonmarital co-living situation. 

## Protect It with a Plan
Whether you are planning on entering a domestic partnership or are in one already, an estate plan is necessary to benefit both parties when one passes away. The best way to be certain that your domestic partnership gets similar benefits to what comes with the legal status granted with marriage is to have an estate plan that represents your partner. 

If you or your partner die without a will and are granted one by the state, your partnership will not be recognized, complicating the ability of the surviving partner to acquire any property or assets. Their other family members will be prioritized, and there’s a good chance not much, if anything at all, will be left for the partner of the deceased. If you die without a will and have a spouse, you are automatically entitled to half of the estate. 

Putting together an estate plan for each partner is not only beneficial, but crucial to ensure that there are no issues down the road if one partner dies before the other. This will allow you as a participant in a domestic partnership to leave behind anything you wish for the other to have once you are no longer around. This way, you can leave half of your estate to them, if you’d like, just as would happen in the case of the death of a spouse. Additionally, including your domestic partner in your will allows them to make medical decisions on your behalf if you become incapacitated, allow their name to be transferred to any official documents you may have (lease, mortgage, deed). You’ll also want to address other accounts you may share or want to be transferred over to them, such as mobile service, utilities or internet, along with household items you share. If you have kids or pets and you’d like to appoint your domestic partner as a guardian, it’s necessary to state this in your will. Doing this will also prevent any family members you are not friendly with to have legal access to anything or anyone you care about, and putting it under the care of your partner.

No matter how you’d like to have your possessions distributed after your death, an estate plan will allow you to have this managed exactly according to your wishes. Without one, your domestic partner will run into some trouble. Luckily, Endowl can help you do this easily: with one tool, you can set up a legal will and even add your partner to it, so they will know exactly what role they will play and even be notified that it’s time for your plan to be executed after your passing. 

Don’t prevent your partner from inheriting any property or assets you’d want them to have—solidify your desires for them in a legal will. People may be hesitant to include a domestic partner in their will, as it may make the relationship feel permanent. You may not be ready for such a significant commitment, and that’s okay. Fortunately, Endowl makes it easy to update your estate plan if you need to in the future.
