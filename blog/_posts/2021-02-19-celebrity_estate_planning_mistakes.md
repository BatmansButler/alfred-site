Having an estate plan is important for everyone, no matter what. Without a will, or with an estate plan that hasn’t been kept up to date, their heirs can be left with quite the mess. Everyone makes mistakes, even your favorite celebrities; keep these mistakes in mind so you know what to avoid in your own estate plan. Your will isn’t something you want to mess up!

## Prince
It’s hard to believe, but the Purple One died intestate, without a will. Even almost 5 years after his death, Prince’s heirs are still struggling to settle the estate. With six siblings and half-siblings, there was a lot of room for interpretation when it came down to getting everyone their share of the estate, which was left up to a Minnesota judge. To further complicate things, an inmate who claimed to be Prince’s child allowed for an even more significant delay. While everyone in charge of distributing his estate has been profiting during the process, with attorney fees and other expenses, Prince’s family has only received a small fraction of the estate. 

## Aretha Franklin
Also dying without a will, the distribution of Aretha Franklin’s $80 million estate was hard to manage. As you would expect, Franklin’s possessions were to be split amongst her four sons evenly. Unfortunately, one of her sons has special needs and is represented by a guardian; without financial assistance, Clarence Franklin struggles to get by. The hardships were significant for Clarence, as his guardian received aid for Clarence from Aretha, and her lack of an estate plan complicated things further for her oldest child. Similar to Prince’s situation, the fact that Franklin died intestate made the distribution process messy, and made what could have been a private family matter very public. When you die without a will, your estate will end up in probate court, allowing anyone to have access to that information. Additionally, the taxes on the estate ended up way higher than they would have been had a will been properly set up. 

## Heath Ledger
Once you have a will, it is important to keep it up-to-date. When Heath Ledger passed away without updating his will prior to his daughter’s birth. His sisters and parents were included, which resulted in them receiving the entire estate, leaving his young child and her mother with nothing. Luckily, the family members who did end up as beneficiaries gave everything Ledger had left for them to his daughter. 

This is why you should regularly be updating your will. Whenever something major happens in your life, say, you’re expecting a child, make sure they are added to your plan even prior to their birth, so in the case that something happens to you, your child will be taken care of. 

## Marlon Brando 
The A Streetcar Named Desire actor made the mistake of making a promise he didn’t put on paper. In his will, his estate was left to his professional associates. His housekeeper, however, claimed Brando promised her that she would inherit his house upon his death. As this wasn’t stated anywhere in his estate plan, resulting in a lawsuit that made executing Brando’s will more complex than anyone would have liked. 

The takeaway here is that you should not make any verbal promises if you can’t put them in writing. Your will is the only thing that can say who gets what after your death. 

## Whitney Houston
Even though she was divorced, her ex-husband still ended up with a lot more than he should have since Houston stopped updating her will before they got divorced. Although she left her estate to her daughter, Bobbi, she sadly died at the age of 22, only receiving 10% of the estate as she was to inherit a certain percentage in three different installments up until age 30. While the remaining 90% went to Houston’s brothers and mother, her ex-husband ended up with what was left of Bobbi’s share. 

It’s crucial to keep your will updated! If you don’t want your ex to reap any benefits of your passing, make sure that not only are you making sure you make the necessary changes, but that you’re specific about what happens to your beneficiaries inherited assets if they end up 
dying sooner than expected, especially if they are young enough to not yet have an estate plan of their own.
