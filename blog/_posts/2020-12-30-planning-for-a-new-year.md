It's that time of year when we tend to look ahead and ask, "how can I make next year better?" 2020 was tough, and there are dozens of reasons to hope for a better 2021. Slowly but surely, The world will start to return to the normal we knew before the pandemic.

But, a return to normal is just the baseline. If we add a few intentional goals, we can emerge from the pandemic better than we were going in: It's time for some New Year's resolutions.

*Collective groan...*

Don’t bail just yet! Yes, it’s hard to follow through with your New Year’s resolutions. When life starts to catch up with you, there’s not enough time to go to the gym, picking up a new hobby feels less realistic, and it's hard to eat healthy all the time, especially with so much going on. This year, think a little outside the box when it comes to setting up your resolutions. Set yourself up for success from the start.

#### Stumbling Toward Success
2021 is likely to be better than 2020. With the stresses caused by the global pandemic, financial uncertainty, and civil unrest all starting to recede, you will see more positive changes in your life. While there are still issues that need to be addressed, at least we will be addressing them without the spectre of an unknown virus hanging over everything. Unlike the early months of 2020, we have an understanding of COVID-19 that will help bring this chapter of our lives to a close, allowing for new, hopeful beginnings in the coming year.

Why not set your other resolutions up to have a similar course? Find ways to set up resolutions so that you can stumble into success. If you want to start putting more money in savings, find ways to make it automatic. Use payroll deductions and automatic bank transfers to make sure that your savings plan will happen automatically. To save both money and time, set up a monthly (or weekly) delivery service for things like groceries and other necessities, so you don’t give in to grabbing those extra things you crave but don’t need while out shopping.

Tactics like these can help you make worthwhile differences in your life with less effort than you might think.

#### Setting Up a Plan for Your Life's Journey
Have you thought about what happens to your stuff and the people that you love when you are gone?

*Another collective groan...*

As much as we all resist thinking about the end of our existence, it is smart to plan for what will happen to those we care about if we should die unexpectedly. Maybe you have thought about setting up will. Maybe you have even gone to one of those websites that generate a will for you and started to fill out the form. Maybe you finished creating a will, but never had it notarized or signed by witnesses. Or maybe you did all of that, but didn't make sure that your executor and heirs know how to get the documents when they are needed.

Endowl is building an app that makes it easy to do all of that. It asks you about the people and things that are important to you, then helps you create the plan that reflects your wishes. Once you have a plan, it monitors for events that might change it. For example, if you have another child or move to a different state, it is a good idea to update your will to reflect this. The app automatically detects these events and reminds you that your will needs to be updated.

#### Resolve to Make a Plan
The Endowl app isn’t quite ready yet, but it will be soon. For a limited time, we are offering a pre-sale where you can sign up for Endowl now and get a special price. If setting up a will is on your to-do list for 2021, this is a great opportunity to put your plan in action today. You will get early access to the Endowl app and will be among the first to experience the Endowl estate planning process.

To get an invitation to the pre-sale, **submit your email address using the form at the bottom of this page**. We will send you an email with instructions for how to sign up for the pre-sale.

After you’ve done that, you will have taken the first step toward following through on your New Years’ resolution.

When the app is ready (in the next 2 or 3 months), we will let you know so that you can continue building toward your goal of having the estate plan that is right for you and your loved ones. We promise to help you create an excellent plan in an easy, frictionless way to make sure that the people and things that you care most about are taken care of after you’ve passed on.

Now that you’ve got your resolution ready for the new year, you’re officially ready to put 2020 behind you, and look forward to a bright 2021.
