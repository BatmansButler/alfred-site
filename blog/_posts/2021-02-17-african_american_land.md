It’s not uncommon for minorities to lose out on ancestral land when a loved one passes away. For many in Black communities, the property that rightfully belongs to their families becomes heirs’ property. This term defines property owned by multiple people with a shared ancestor that previously owned the land and died without a legal will. When this is the case, families can end up losing their homes as well as a significant amount of wealth. This long running problem can be difficult to avoid for many, especially with estate planning kept out of reach from Southern Black areas. 

## Heirs’ Property
With heirs’ property, the state divides the land up between the surviving family members, but, as the generations pass, dozens upon dozens of relatives could end up owning the same amount of one single property. The forced communal ownership of family land is problematic for many reasons, and is a huge burden for those affected. 

This leaves Black communities at a disadvantage, as they tend to be left without access to the proper legal channels that are required for creating a proper will. In the South, approximately one third of all land that is Black-owned becomes heirs’ property. This can result in the property to be sold without explicit permission from all of the owners, even if some of them are currently residing there. If even one person who is entitled to a fraction of a particular piece of land has the desire to sell, the procedure that allows this to happen gives a judge the ability to sell the entire property for far less than it’s worth. Heirs’ property can also prevent owners from using the land to acquire loans and doesn’t permit eligibility for federal disaster relief. 

The Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act (UPHPA), enacted in 2010, is designed to help prevent people from ending up in such situations by providing those affected by heirs’ property with certain protections, such as notice, right to a first refusal, appraisal, and an option for the court to oversee any sale of the property and ensure that all owners receive what they are owed. An additional, more recent law in South Carolina keeps the land in question under the name of the original, recently deceased owner.

While the UPHPA and other related laws serve to aid the troubles caused by heirs’ property, the racial gap due to unfair laws is far from closed. Although it’s a step in the right direction, there is still more to be done. The best way to eliminate issues caused by heirs’ property is to provide the communities that are at the highest risk of falling victim to losing family owned land with the ability to easily create an estate plan.

## The Importance of a Legal Will
One of the reasons heirs’ property is so common in southern Black communities is because so many landowners are without an estate plan due to inaccessibility. When there is a proper, legal will in place, inherited land can actually be given to the rightful beneficiaries without having to worry about it being sold or taken away. 

By giving minorities in the South the means to make an estate plan that abides by state law, the risk of them losing what they rightfully own decreases significantly. Unfortunately, it can be expensive and difficult to do this properly. But, with apps like Endowl, estate planning can happen right on your phone, without having to pay steep fees to use an attorney. 

Changing laws that needlessly threaten the ancestral farms of Black families in the South is necessary. But, so is widening the spectrum of those who are able to have a will in place that will actually be useful upon its execution. Luckily, the future of estate planning is designed to simplify a process that is currently complex and outdated.
