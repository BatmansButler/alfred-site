How often do you think about creating a will? Maybe a few times, every now and then. You know you need one, sure. But it feels like you have plenty of time to get all of your ducks in a row before your final day, doesn’t it? Of course, this is a universal feeling. It’s human nature to be afraid of death, and desire to avoid thinking about it at all costs. And yet, the reality is, you never truly know how close you are to approaching your final day. The best thing you can do, for yourself and for your loved ones, is to create an estate plan and be prepared. It doesn’t have to be hard or even scary; it’s just another thing you need to do, just as you need to set your alarm for work every morning, or remember to send a birthday card to your mother every year.

# The Ritual
Don’t think of it as a long, daunting process full of intimidating phone calls and dreadful errands. Your estate plan shouldn’t be anything like that; after all, this is your legacy. And your legacy should be well taken care of, as if it’s a beloved pet or a cherished memento. This is why keeping your estate plan updated is so important—it represents so much more than just providing direction for what will happen to your possessions after your casket is lowered and your friends and family parade away from your final resting place, teary-eyed and dressed in their nicest black clothes. It represents your life as a whole. Everyone you loved, every collection you spent time and money keeping up with, the places you lived, the things you invested in. All of that is something to remember, something worth preserving.

Every year, you make a New Year’s resolution. It’s become a fun ritual to do so; but unlike your New Year’s resolution, the ritual of maintaining your estate plan isn’t something to give up on once February comes around. Your life will always be changing, and with that, your legacy will, too. Make time every year to go over your plan, and make updates where they are needed.

# Optimizing for Desired Outcomes
Regularly visualizing the current and ideal states of your legacy sets you up for happy accidents that benefit you and your family. Having a proper plan for your estate will minimize the costs and maximize the benefits for your loved ones—what could sound more enticing than benefiting the people who mean the most to you?

Without a plan in place, these benefits won’t quite measure up to what they could be. Your estate will be handled in a way that most likely won’t be best suited to what you would have wanted. There’s no better feeling than knowing that the people and things that mattered most to you during your time on Earth are well taken care of once you are gone. A well thought out estate plan will give you the best possible outcomes for your personal belongings and the people in your life you care about.

# The Ultimate Life Hack
When you prepare your estate plan and update it on a regular basis, you’re setting yourself and your family up for a successful future. While ignoring the necessity of estate planning while you’re still here may feel like the easier option, it will only make things harder for those who you are leaving behind. It’s important to prepare for this before you get to a point where it becomes the focus of your worry, or even before it becomes too late.

Having your legacy live on through your physical property and loved ones is the life hack you won’t see in a funny video you scroll by on social media, but it is the one that will be the most advantageous to you and your family. When this process is designed in a way that’s complex, boring, and let’s face it, pretty depressing, it doesn’t exactly feel beneficial to where you’re currently at in life. But, when the process focuses on you, it becomes a journey instead of a chore.

Make the journey as easy as possible both now, and later. While you may end up telling yourself you’ll try again next year after your resolution doesn’t work out, choosing to life hack your legacy is a promise worth keeping.
