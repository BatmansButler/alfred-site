If the idea of estate planning sounds overwhelming, know that you’re not alone - over half of American adults lack any form of a will or estate plan.

Whether or not you’re wealthy enough to own an estate, it’s important to have an estate plan to ensure your affairs will be handled the way you want if something happens and you’re unable to make decisions.

Creating an estate plan is about more than just writing a will; it’s about making sure your loved ones aren’t faced with more difficulty than they need to when handling your estate.

## The Estate Planning Checklist 

<br>

### 1. Document Your Assets

<br>

Create an inventory of your: 

- [ ] Cash and Financial Accounts

- [ ] Investments

- [ ] Insurance Policies

- [ ] Memberships (AARP, Professional Associations, etc.)

- [ ] Valuable Assets

- [ ] Sentimental Assets

Be sure to include details like account numbers, how to access each item, and what person or company might need to be contacted.

Sign and date the lists when you’re finished with them and make copies to store in a safety deposit box and share with the person you want to administer your estate.

### 2. Plan Your Estate

<br>

- [ ] Select an executor, also referred to as an estate administrator

- [ ] Write a letter to your heirs explaining:

  - [ ] How to access your will, passwords, and financial accounts

  - [ ] What to do with your things

  - [ ] Who can help access anything important

Store the letter in a safe location such as a safety deposit box and be sure to give a copy to your estate administrator.

- [ ] Consider creating these documents to legally protect your wishes:

  - [ ] Simple Will

    - [ ] Designate the beneficiaries of your estate

    - [ ] Designate guardianship for children, pets, or others in your care

    - [ ] Select an estate administrator    

  - [ ] Living Trust

  - [ ] Financial Power of Attorney

  - [ ] Medical Power of Attorney

  - [ ] Medical Directive

  - [ ] Living Will

A Simple Will, Power of Attorney, Medical Power of Attorney, and Living Will are the most important documents to consider.

These documents can be created using templates offered by various online services or drafted by an attorney who specializes in estate planning.

Whichever route you take, the documents will likely need to be witnessed and notarized in order to carry their legal weight. See the rules in your jurisdiction for more details.

What you need to do to legally protect your wishes can depend on a number of factors, including:

* Whether you’re single or married
* Where you live
* The size and complexity of your estate
* How many beneficiaries you want to leave items to

- [ ] Designate beneficiaries for your financial accounts

  - [ ] Set up transfer on death (TOD) designation

  - [ ] Life Insurance

  - [ ] Retirement Accounts

Most financial institutions enable account holders to designate beneficiaries for their accounts. 

Designating a beneficiary for your accounts and insurance policies will allow them to directly pass to those individuals upon your death without having to go through probate.

<h3>3. Review and Communicate Your Plan</h3>

<br>

Major changes in your life like marriage, having kids, or buying a house are all points at which you will want to review your estate plan.

- [ ] Communicate your wishes to the individual or individuals tasked with representing your legal and medical wishes and executing your estate plan

- [ ] Review the plan every 3 years or when major changes occur in your life

Talking about your final wishes is never easy but the more you communicate with those responsible for carrying out your wishes, the easier it will be for them to handle the responsibility when the time comes.
