Baby boomers are the 72.5 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964.The oldest boomers are around the age of 75, and even most of those on the younger end of that spectrum are retired. At this point in their lives, they’re getting ready to leave their wealth behind for their loved ones. 

## Large Intergenerational Transfer of Wealth
With the boomers slowly making their way toward the end of their time on earth, their assets have to go somewhere. Whether they have an estate plan or not, their children will end up receiving most of this money and property. This is significant because of the sheer number of people involved—naturally, more people will collectively own more assets. So, if the boomers in question and their heirs aren’t prepared, whatever is inherited might not be handled as well as it could. 

With an estimated total of $59 trillion rolling into the accounts of boomer beneficiaries—most likely millennials—in the coming decades, the taxes the ill-prepared will face aren’t going to be pretty, and the outcome will be a lot more hectic than necessary. 

## Be Prepared
If parents are  baby boomers, now is the best time to talk to them about their will. While the conversation may not be fun, it's necessary to ensure the best for everyone involved. And if you’re a boomer yourself, it’s time to think about what you own, what you’ll be passing on to your heirs, and how to even begin approaching the whole thing. Do you own any digital assets, or have property that will need tending to once you’re gone? Do you have savings that would allow your kids to save for their own children’s college? There’s a lot to think about, and this thinking should be done in the best way possible. Make sure the people you are including in your plan are well informed about the role they are playing in your will. When you don’t tell your beneficiaries what’s going to happen after you pass away, they aren’t going to know what to do, or how to deal with what you end up leaving them. This can cause a lot of trouble when it comes to taxes and the distribution of your assets, not to mention the stress it might put on your loved ones.
