Marriage is a happy milestone in your journey through life. When you get married, you’re bringing a new member into your family to start a new chapter with: how exciting! If you already have a will, it probably will to to be updated after you say your “I do’s” and sign the the marriage license. Most states, have specific rules for inhertance between spouses, so adding them to your plan is critical. Not only does this momentous occasion change your life, but it changes your estate plan, too.

## Before the Wedding
If you’ve yet to wed, it’s a good idea to consider your estate plan now to secure any assets that you’d like to keep separate from your marriage. This might include something like a trust fund from a relative, accounts pertaining to children from a previous partnership or marriage, or other properties you wouldn’t want your new spouse to inherit.

You’ll want to discuss this with your significant other beforehand, so everyone is in the loop about the agreements you need to make. This is a great time to think about how you’d like to include your new family in the assets you may have attained prior to meeting them, in order to make estate plan adjustments as seamless as possible. The last thing you want is an unexpected disagreement, so solidifying important decisions in advance will save you time and prevent unexpected stress or tension.

## After the Honeymoon
Once you return from your vacation and start to settle into your new life, it’s time to revisit the considerations about how your new spouse and/or family is affected by your will. It’s important to do this as soon as you can, because in the case of an unexpected death, your spouse might not receive everything you’d like them to if you never got around to updating your estate plan.

If you’re planning on having children, keep this in mind when updating your plan. You can set up a fund for their future education, and get a head start on helping them afford college. If you now have new stepchildren due to the marriage, you’ll need to consider similar things for them, too. What will your kids need in order to be taken care of if you are no longer there? If you are survived by your spouse, their inclusion as well as the inclusion of their children is crucial to assuring that your family is provided for no matter what.

A new marriage is an exciting adventure to embark on. Put your vows to work by making your estate plan a priority, so your new spouse will be well represented in your will and receive everything you’d like them to if you were ever to pass away suddenly. You want to take care of your family, and keep all the promises you made. Place this love and care into your legacy plan, so it is clearly displayed in what you’re leaving behind.
