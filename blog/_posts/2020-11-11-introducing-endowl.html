Most people have valuable digital assets, whether they realize it or not.

<br><br>

Whether weâ€™re talking about the growing market for cryptocurrency or the files and accounts most people store and access through their computers, digital assets are a growing
part of peopleâ€™s everyday lives.

<br><br>

Unfortunately, providing access to these assets once their owners can no longer be responsible for them often involves providing heirs with highly-specific instructions and in
some cases, requires them to jump through legal hurdles in order to access the assets.

<br><br>

<h2>Introducing Endowl ðŸ¦‰</h2>

Endowl ðŸ¦‰ is changing the way people think about estate planning by crafting an engaging way to plan your legacy.

<br><br>

Ken Hodler, Morgan Sherwood, Seth Goldfarb, and Aaron Anderson came together as Team  Alfred for the ETHDenver 2020 hackathon to work on issues relating to security in the
Ethereum ecosystem.

<br><br>

Discussion about what to build led to the problem of cryptocurrency inheritance. A quick search revealed several attempts at solutions but nothing addressed the technical and
legal issues involved in digital estate planning in way that satisfied the team.

<br><br>

The proof-of-concept won a bounty from Kyber Network and the encouragement Team Alfred received motivated them to continue exploring the market for digital inheritance.

<br><br>

<h2>What Weâ€™re Building</h2>

Our solution will help people and companies maintain legacy access to digital assets and documents after their death or incapacitation while maintaining privacy, accessibility, and flexibility.

<br><br>

The solutions weâ€™re creating:

<br><br>

<li>Guide users through the estate planning process</li>
<li>Provide methods for generating proof-of-death or incapacitation</li>
<li>Automate the distribution of assets in accordance with the ownerâ€™s wishes</li>

<br>

Since ETHDenver, Endowlâ€™s ðŸ¦‰ journey has led:

<br><br>

<li>To victory in MetaCartelâ€™s Dragon Quest with 2nd place out of 70 entries and a bounty from Gnosis for building a recovery dApp using Gnosisâ€™ contract proxy kit</li>
<li>To new insights on the issues surrounding digital inheritance through user testing advised by the Maker Foundationâ€™s Jordan Jackson</li>
<li>To our current participation in Consensysâ€™ Tachyon Accelerator Program</li>
