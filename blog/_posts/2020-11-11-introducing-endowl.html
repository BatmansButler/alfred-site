Let's face it: estate planning is an uncomfortable task.

<br><br>

It means facing your mortality and making difficult decisions about how you want your affairs to be handled, taking on the 
task of communicating those wishes to loved ones, and sifting through legalese to make sure your wishes are properly 
protected. 

<br><br>

Estate planning may be difficult but it's more than just a precaution; it's about making sure the fruits of your labor continue to
support your loved ones when you're no longer able to and ensuring that decisions are made about your affairs in a way
you're comfortable with.

<br><br>

<h2>Introducing Endowl ðŸ¦‰</h2>

Endowl ðŸ¦‰ is changing the way people think about estate planning by crafting an engaging way to plan your legacy.

<br><br>

We came together as Team  Alfred for the ETHDenver 2020 hackathon to work on issues relating to security in the
Ethereum ecosystem.

<br><br>

Discussion about what to build led to the problem of cryptocurrency inheritance. A quick search revealed several attempts at solutions but nothing addressed the technical and
legal issues involved in digital estate planning in way that satisfied the team.

<br><br>

The proof-of-concept won a bounty from Kyber Network and the encouragement Team Alfred received motivated them to continue exploring the market for digital inheritance.

<br><br>
