<p>A draft post such as this allows saving work in progress without making that work public.</p>

<p>To view draft posts when developing locally, add <code>--drafts</code> to the end of the <code>jekyl serve</code> command.</p>

<p>Draft files should not include the date in the filename. The current date will automatically be used in the generated url when testing through Jekyll.</p>
