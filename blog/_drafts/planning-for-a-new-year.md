It's that time of year when we tend to look ahead to the coming year and ask "How can I make next year better?" 2020 was tough! There are a lot of reasons to hope for a better 2021 The world will soon start to return to a post-pandemic "normal".

But a return to normal is just the baseline. We should be able to achieve that without doing anything. If we add a few intentional goals, we can emerge from the pandemic better than we were when we went in.

It's time for some New Year's resolutions.

*collective groan*

Yes, it’s hard to follow through with your New Year’s resolutions. When life starts to catch up with you, there’s not enough time to go to the gym, picking up a new hobby feels less realistic, and it's hard to eat healthy all the time, with so much going on. This year, think a little outside the box when it comes to setting up your resolutions. Set yourself up to succeed from the start.

#### Stumbling Toward Success
Without doing anything, 2021 is likely to be better than 2020. With the stresses caused by the global pandemic, financial uncertainty, and civil unrest starting to recede, you will see positive changes in your life. To be sure, there are still issues that need to be addressed, but at least we will be addressing them without the spectre of a global pandemic hanging over everything. This alone, brings hope that 2021 will be better than 2020.

Why not set your other resolutions up to have a similar course? Find ways to set up resolutions so that you can stumble into success. If you want to start putting more money in savings, find ways to make it automatic. Use payroll deductions and automatic bank transfers to make sure that your savings plan will happen AUTOMATICALLY.

Tactics like this can help you make positive changes in your life with little effort.

#### Setting Up a Plan for Your Life's Journey
Have you thought about what happens to your stuff and the people that you love when you are gone?

*another collective groan*

As much as we all resist thinking about the end of our existence, it is smart to plan for what will happen to those we care about if we should die unexpectedly. Maybe you have thought about setting up will. Maybe you have even gone to one of those websites that generate a will for you and started to fill out the form. Maybe you finished creating a will, but never had it notarized or signed by witnesses. Or maybe you did all of that, but didn't make sure that your executor and heirs know how to get the documents when they are needed.

Endowl is building an app that makes it easy to do all of that. It asks you about the people and things that are important to you, then helps you create the plan that reflects your wishes. One you have a plan, it monitors for events that might change it. For example, if you have another child or move to a different state, it is a good idea to update your will to reflect this. The app automatically detects these events and reminds you that your will needs to be updated.

#### Your New Year’s Resolution
Every year, you make a new year’s resolution in hopes it will bring a positive change into your life. Some popular resolutions include saving money, becoming more organized, watching less television, among others. The point is always to try and make your life better than it was the previous year. But, New Year’s resolutions are notorious for being abandoned come February or March, sometimes with the mindset that “there’s always next time.”

It’s time to change that. This year, make a resolution that strays from the norm, one that not only aims to make improvements in your life, but one that does so for your family, too. With everything that happened this past year, you may have started to question what might happen to your family and belongings if you were to pass away before your time, especially if you have young children.

This year, make your resolution to start estate planning. Having an estate plan will give you full control over how your assets are managed upon your death. Even when you’re gone, of  course you will want to have a say on what happens to your family and personal information. With an estate plan, this is exactly what you’ll get.

#### Resolve to Make a Plan
The Endowl app isn’t quite ready yet, but it will be soon. For a limited time, we are offering a pre-sale where you can sign up for Endowl now and get a special price.

You will have taken the first step toward following through on your New Years’ resolution.

When the app is ready, in the next 2 or 3 months, we will let you know so that you can continue building toward your goal of having the estate plan that is right for you and your loved ones. We promise that we will make it as easy as possible to create the right plan in a way that makes super easy (maybe even a little bit fun) to make sure that the people and things that you care most about are taken care of when you are gone.

Now that you’ve got your resolution ready for the new year, you’re officially ready to look forward to a bright 2021.
