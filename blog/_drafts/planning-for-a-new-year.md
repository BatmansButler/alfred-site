2020 was tough. 2021 doesn’t have to be. It’s hard to follow through with your New Year’s resolution when life starts to catch up with you—there’s not enough time to go to the gym, picking up a new hobby feels less realistic, and it's hard to eat healthy all the time, with so much going on. This time, think a little outside the box when it comes to looking forward to the next twelve months. Get your new year off to a good start by making a resolution you won’t soon want to forget.

#### Your New Year’s Resolution
Every year, you make a new year’s resolution in hopes it will bring a positive change into your life. Some popular resolutions include saving money, becoming more organized, watching less television, among others. The point is always to try and make your life better than it was the previous year. But, New Year’s resolutions are notorious for being abandoned come February or March, sometimes with the mindset that “there’s always next time.”

It’s time to change that. This year, make a resolution that strays from the norm, one that not only aims to make improvements in your life, but one that does so for your family, too. With everything that happened this past year, you may have started to question what might happen to your family and belongings if you were to pass away before your time, especially if you have young children.

This year, make your resolution to start estate planning. Having an estate plan will give you full control over how your assets are managed upon your death. Even when you’re gone, of  course you will want to have a say on what happens to your family and personal information. With an estate plan, this is exactly what you’ll get.
