Think of your estate plan as an exclusive social network. By invite only, your life and family as the center of it all. Just as you would on any other media platform, you can connect with your loved ones so they have access to viewing the aspects of your plan that are relevant to them. Mainstream methods of planning your estate can be pretty confusing, and your beneficiaries might have trouble with their involvement if they aren’t directly participating. When nearly everyone has a smartphone these days, it’s so easy to bring your will to the small screen for frictionless management for your entire network. 

## Your Network 
The average middle class family with children has around 7 to 12 parties named in their estate plan. This is your own personal social network, the people you are closest to and care the most about. Typically family members, or even very close friends. 

Of course, everyone’s network will be a little different. If you have young children, you’ll need to name a guardian to take over their care. Your spouse and adult children will be included as well, (though they probably won’t need a guardian!) potentially in some of the positions we’re about to go over. 

You’ll need an appointed trustee, who will oversee the trust itself, collecting assets, and taking care of certain taxes. This person should be someone you trust with your life. Literally! Another person of similar importance is your executor, who will be in charge of the estate, paying estate expenses and distributing assets to beneficiaries. Your will executor will be the one carrying out your last wishes, so make sure you’re overly comfortable with the person you choose for this role as well. 

Additionally, you may want to include people like witnesses, your attorney, or special executors in your network, too, depending on your needs. 

With people like guardians, trustees, and will executors, you should be ready to have an alternative for the position, just in case. If the time comes where they need to fulfill their responsibilities as stated in the will and they are unable, you’ll need to call in a backup who is ready to fill those shoes. 

## Staying Connected 
With the Endowl app, your network will be a lot more organized and easy to manage than with a typical estate plan. Every party named in your will, with the exception of children under the age of 18, will receive an invitation to install the app when they are added to the plan. This allows them to actively be a part of your estate so they can become familiar with their role early on. They will receive notifications when any changes are made, and be able to see everything right in the app. This way, you’ll know for a fact that your network is always up to date with everything estate plan wise, completely avoiding any complex situations that could be encountered with a different legacy planning process. Endowl will keep your loved ones connected in the ways that matter most.
